-- | Update the root metadata
--
-- Note that the new root metadata is verified using the old root metadata,
-- and only then trusted.
--
-- We don't always have root file information available. If we notice during
-- the normal update process that the root information has changed then the
-- snapshot will give us the new file information; but if we need to update
-- the root information due to a verification error we do not.
--
-- We additionally delete the cached cached snapshot and timestamp. This is
-- necessary for two reasons:
--
-- 1. If during the normal update process we notice that the root info was
--    updated (because the hash of @root.json@ in the new snapshot is different
--    from the old snapshot) we download new root info and start over, without
--    (yet) downloading a (potential) new index. This means it is important that
--    we not overwrite our local cached snapshot, because if we did we would
--    then on the next iteration conclude there were no updates and we would
--    fail to notice that we should have updated the index. However, unless we
--    do something, this means that we would conclude on the next iteration once
--    again that the root info has changed (because the hash in the new shapshot
--    still doesn't match the hash in the cached snapshot), and we would loop
--    until we throw a 'VerificationErrorLoop' exception. By deleting the local
--    snapshot we basically reset the client to its initial state, and we will
--    not try to download the root info once again. The only downside of this is
--    that we will also re-download the index after every root info change.
--    However, this should be infrequent enough that this isn't an issue.
--    See also <https://github.com/theupdateframework/tuf/issues/285>.
--
-- 2. Additionally, deleting the local timestamp and snapshot protects against
--    an attack where an attacker has set the file version of the snapshot or
--    timestamp to MAX_INT, thereby making further updates impossible.
--    (Such an attack would require a timestamp/snapshot key compromise.)
--
-- However, we _ONLY_ do this when the root information has actually changed.
-- If we did this unconditionally it would mean that we delete the locally
-- cached timestamp whenever the version on the remote timestamp is invalid,
-- thereby rendering the file version on the timestamp and the snapshot useless.
-- See <https://github.com/theupdateframework/tuf/issues/283#issuecomment-115739521>

  Access to the tar index (the API is exported and used internally)

  NOTE: The files inside the index as evaluated lazily.

  1. The index tarball contains delegated target.json files for both unsigned
     and signed packages. We need to verify the signatures of all signed
     metadata (that is: the metadata for signed packages).

  2. Since the tarball also contains the .cabal files, we should also verify the
     hashes of those .cabal files against the hashes recorded in signed metadata
     (there is no point comparing against hashes recorded in unsigned metadata
     because attackers could just change those).

  Since we don't have author signing yet, we don't have any additional signed
  metadata and therefore we currently don't have to do anything here.

  TODO: If we have explicit, author-signed, lists of versions for a package (as
  described in @README.md@), then evaluating these "middle-level" delegation
  files lazily opens us up to a rollback attack: if we've never downloaded the
  delegations for a package before, then we have nothing to compare the version
  number in the file that we downloaded against. One option is to always
  download and verify all these middle level files (strictly); other is to
  include the version number of all of these files in the snapshot. This is
  described in more detail in
  <https://github.com/theupdateframework/tuf/issues/282#issuecomment-102468421>.

  TODO: Currently we hardcode the location of the package specific metadata. By
  rights we should read the global targets file and apply the delegation rules.
  Until we have author signing however this is unnecessary.
