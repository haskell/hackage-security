-- | Trusted values
--
-- Trusted values originate in only two ways:
--
-- * Anything that is statically known is trusted ('trustStatic')
-- * If we have "dynamic" data we can trust it once we have verified the
--   the signatures (trustSigned).
--
-- NOTE: Trusted is NOT a functor. If it was we could define
--
-- > trustAnything :: a -> Trusted a
-- > trustAnything a = fmap (const a) (trustStatic (static ()))
--
-- Consequently, it is neither a monad nor a comonad. However, we _can_ apply
-- trusted functions to trusted arguments ('trustApply').
--
-- The 'DeclareTrusted' constructor is exported, but any use of it should be
-- verified.
newtype Trusted a = DeclareTrusted { trusted :: a }
  deriving (Eq, Show)

trustStatic :: StaticPtr a -> Trusted a
trustStatic = DeclareTrusted . deRefStaticPtr

trustVerified :: SignaturesVerified a -> Trusted a
trustVerified = DeclareTrusted . signaturesVerified

-- | Equivalent of '<*>'
--
-- Trusted isn't quite applicative (no pure, not a functor), but it is
-- somehow Applicative-like: we have the equivalent of '<*>'
trustApply :: Trusted (a -> b) -> Trusted a -> Trusted b
trustApply (DeclareTrusted f) (DeclareTrusted x) = DeclareTrusted (f x)

-- | Trust all elements of some trusted (traversable) container
--
-- If we have, say, a trusted list of values, we should be able to get a list
-- of trusted values out of it.
--
-- > trustElems :: Trusted [a] -> [Trusted a]
--
-- NOTE. It might appear that the more natural primitive to offer is a
-- 'sequenceA'-like operator such as
--
-- > trustSeq :: Applicative f => Trusted (f a) -> f (Trusted a)
--
-- However, this is unsound. To see this, consider that @((->) a)@ is
-- 'Applicative' (it's the reader monad); hence, we can instantiate 'trustSeq'
-- at
--
-- > trustSeq :: Trusted (a -> a) -> a -> Trusted a
--
-- and by passing @trustStatic (static id)@ make 'Trusted' a functor, which we
-- certainly don't want to do (see comments for 'Trusted').
--
-- So why is it okay when we insist on 'Traversable' rather than 'Applicative'?
-- To see this, it's instructive to consider how we might make a @((->) a)@ an
-- instance of 'Traversable'. If we define the domain of enumerable types as
--
-- > class Eq a => Enumerable a where
-- >   enumerate :: [a]
--
-- then we can make @((->) r)@ traversable by
--
-- > instance Enumerable r => Traversable ((->) r) where
-- >   sequenceA f = rebuild <$> sequenceA ((\r -> (r,) <$> f r) <$> enumerate)
-- >     where
-- >       rebuild :: [(r, a)] -> r -> a
-- >       rebuild fun arg = fromJust (lookup arg fun)
--
-- The idea is that if the domain of a function is enumerable, we can apply the
-- function to each possible input, collect the outputs, and construct a new
-- function by pairing the inputs with the outputs. I.e., if we had something of
-- type
--
-- > a -> IO b
--
-- and @a@ is enumerable, we just run the @IO@ action on each possible @a@ and
-- collect all @b@s to get a pure function @a -> b@. Of course, you probably
-- don't want to be doing that, but the point is that as far as the type system
-- is concerned you could.
--
-- In the context of 'Trusted', this means that we can derive
--
-- > enumPure :: Enumerable a => a -> Trusted a
--
-- but in a way this this makes sense anyway. If a domain is enumerable, it
-- would not be unreasonable to change @Enumerable@ to
--
-- > class Eq a => Enumerable a where
-- >   enumerate :: [StaticPtr a]
--
-- so we could define @enumPure@ as
--
-- > enumPure :: Enumerable a => a -> Trusted a
-- > enumPure x = trustStatic
-- >            $ fromJust (find ((== x) . deRefStaticPtr) enumerate)
--
-- In other words, we just enumerate the entire domain as trusted values
-- (because we defined them locally) and then return the one that matched the
-- untrusted value.
--
-- The conclusion from all of this is that the types of untrusted input  (like
-- the types of the TUF files we download from the server) should probably not
-- be considered enumerable.

-- | Role verification
--
-- NOTE: We throw an error when the version number _decreases_, but allow it
-- to be the same. This is sufficient: the file number is there so that
-- attackers cannot replay old files. It cannot protect against freeze attacks
-- (that's what the expiry date is for), so "replaying" the same file is not
-- a problem. If an attacker changes the contents of the file but not the
-- version number we have an inconsistent situation, but this is not something
-- we need to worry about: in this case the attacker will need to resign the
-- file or otherwise the signature won't match, and if the attacker has
-- compromised the key then he might just as well increase the version number
-- and resign.
--
-- NOTE 2: We are not actually verifying the signatures _themselves_ here
-- (we did that when we parsed the JSON). We are merely verifying the provenance
-- of the keys.
