-- | Repository
--
-- This is an abstract representation of a repository. It simply provides a way
-- to download metafiles and target files, without specifying how this is done.
-- For instance, for a local repository this could just be doing a file read,
-- whereas for remote repositories this could be using any kind of HTTP client.
data Repository down = DownloadedFile down => Repository {
    -- | Get a file from the server
    --
    -- Responsibilies of 'repGetRemote':
    --
    -- * Download the file from the repository and make it available at a
    --   temporary location
    -- * Use the provided file length to protect against endless data attacks.
    --   (Repositories such as local repositories that are not suspectible to
    --   endless data attacks can safely ignore this argument.)
    -- * Move the file from its temporary location to its permanent location
    --   if verification succeeds.
    --
    -- NOTE: Calls to 'repGetRemote' should _always_ be in the scope of
    -- 'repWithMirror'.

    -- This function has this shape so that:

    -- | Mirror selection
    --
    -- The purpose of 'repWithMirror' is to scope mirror selection. The idea
    -- is that if we have
    --
    -- > repWithMirror mirrorList $
    -- >   someCallback
    --
    -- then the repository may pick a mirror before calling @someCallback@,
    -- catch exceptions thrown by @someCallback@, and potentially try the
    -- callback again with a different mirror.
    --
    -- The list of mirrors may be @Nothing@ if we haven't yet downloaded the
    -- list of mirrors from the repository, or when our cached list of mirrors
    -- is invalid. Of course, if we did download it, then the list of mirrors
    -- may still be empty. In this case the repository must fall back to its
    -- primary download mechanism.
    --
    -- Mirrors as currently defined (in terms of a "base URL") are inherently a
    -- HTTP (or related) concept, so in repository implementations such as the
    -- local-repo 'repWithMirrors' is probably just an identity operation  (see
    -- 'ignoreMirrors').  Conversely, HTTP implementations of repositories may
    -- have other, out-of-band information (for example, coming from a cabal
    -- config file) that they may use to influence mirror selection.
