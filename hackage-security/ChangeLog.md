unreleased
----------

* Allow `network-2.7.0.0`
* Allow `aeson-1.4.0.0`

0.5.3.0
-------

* Use `flock(2)`-based locking where available
  (compat-shim taken from `cabal-install`'s code-base) (#207)
* Improve handling of async exceptions (#187)
* Detect & recover from local corruption of uncompressed index tarball (#196)
* Support `base-4.11`

0.5.2.2
-------

* Fix client in case where server provides MD5 hashes
  (ignore them, use only SHA256)
* Fix warnings with GHC 8

0.5.2.1
-------

* Fix accidental breakage with GHC 8

0.5.2.0
-------

* Change path handling to work on Windows (#162).
* Add new MD5 hash type (#163). This is not for security (only SHA256 is
  used for verification) but to provide as metadata to help with other
  services like mirroring (e.g. HTTP & S3 use MD5 checksum headers).
* Adjust reading of JSON maps to ignore unknown keys. This allows adding
  e.g. new hash types in future without breaking existing clients.
* Fix build warnings on GHC 8


0.5.1.0
-------

* Fix for other local programs corrputing the 00-index.tar. Detect it
  and do a full rewrite rather than incremental append.
* New JSON pretty-printer (not canonical rendering)
* Round-trip tests for Canonical JSON parser and printers
* Minor fix for Canonical JSON parser
* Switch from cryptohash to cryptohash-sha256 to avoid new dependencies

0.5.0.2
-------
* Use tar 0.5.0
* Relax lower bound on directory

0.5.0.1
-------
* Relaxed dependency bounds

0.5.0.0
-------
* Treat deserialization errors as verification errors (#108, #75)
* Avoid `Content-Length: 0` in GET requests (#103)
* Fix bug in Trusted
* Build tar-index incrementally (#22)
* Generalize 'Repository' over the representation of downloaded remote files.
* Update index incrementally by downloading delta of `.tar.gz` and writing only
  tail of local `.tar` file (#101). Content compression no longer used.
* Take a lock on the cache directory before updating it, and no longer use
  atomic file ops (pointless since we now update some files incrementally)
* Code refactoring/simplification.
* Support for ed25519 >= 0.0.4
* `downloadPackage` no longer takes a callback.
* API for accessing the Hackage index contents changed; it should now be
  easier for clients to do their own incremental updates should they wish
  to do so.
* Relies on tar >= 0.4.4
* Removed obsolete option for downloading the compressed index (we now _always_
  download the compressed index)
* Path module now works on Windows (#118)
* Dropped support for ghc 7.2
* Replaced uses of Int with Int54, to make sure canonical JSON really is
  canonical (#141).

0.4.0.0
-------
* Allow clients to pass in their own time for expiry verification
  (this is an API change hence the major version bump)
* Export .Client.Formats (necessary to define new Repositories)
* Start work on basic test framework

0.3.0.0
-------
* Don't use compression for range requests (#101)
* Download index.tar.gz, not index.tar, if range request fails (#99)
* Minor change in the LogMessage type (hence the API version bumb)
* Include ChangeLog.md in the tarball (#98)

0.2.0.0
-------
* Allow for network-2.5 (rather than network-uri-2.6)
* Use cryptohash rather than SHA
* Various bugfixes
* API change: introduce RepoOpts in the Remote repository

0.1.0.0
-------
* Initial beta release
